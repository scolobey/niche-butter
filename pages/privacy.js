The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device&apos;s internal memory.</p>
        <p>This Service does not use these &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information and improve their services.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
        <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
          <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
          <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
          <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
